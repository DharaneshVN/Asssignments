    <select>The  element is used to create a drop-down list. The element 
        is most often used in a form, to collect user input. 
        The name attribute is needed to reference the form data 
        after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no
        data from the drop-down list will be submitted).
        </select>
        <button>The  tag defines a clickable button.
        Inside a element you can put text That is not possible 
        with a button created with the  element!
        </button>
